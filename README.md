# Card Animation Project

## Description
This project creates an interactive card UI with smooth animation effects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The cards are styled with CSS and use a 3D perspective to create an engaging layout. The project features multiple cards arranged in a stack, with smooth transitions when switching between them, controlled by mouse wheel scroll events.

The design includes a clean and modern aesthetic, with vibrant colors, animations for user interaction, and a simulated scroll effect using JavaScript.
